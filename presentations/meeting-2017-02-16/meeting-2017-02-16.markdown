* Munich Lord Mayor Deiter Reiter successfully lobbied Microsoft in late 2016 to move its Microsoft Germany corporate headquarters to to Munich.
* Accenture, Microsoft's Alliance Partner of the Year in 2016, was chosen to deliver a fair case on what Munich should do with its city IT desktops.
*  In the report, Accenture, with every reason to recommend Microsoft products, said only between 18 percent and 28 percent of city users had software problems which could be solved by migrating to Windows and MS Office.
