# [1/2 CAB requires all CAs to check and process a domain's CAA before issuing certs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization)
* CAB
  * "A voluntary consortium of certification authorities, vendors of Internet browser software, operating systems, and other PKI-enabled applications that promulgates industry guidelines governing the issuance and management of X.509 v.3 digital certificates that chain to a trust anchor embedded in such applications."
  * [CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org/)
* Certification Authority Authorization
  * [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844) standardized in 2013
  * New DNS Record (type 257)
    * Can list zero by specifying `":"`
    * Comma-separated otherwise
  * Lists CAs that are authorized to provide certs for domain 
  * Therefore it acts as a whitelist (good!)
  * Intended to strengthen PKI
    * Similar to public key pinning (HPKP)
  * CAA record checking takes about 7ms per record

# [2/2 CAB requires all CAs to check and process a domain's CAA before issuing certs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization)
* CAA is largely an administrative control.
  * Enterprises can utilize CAA to force their organization into a uniform issuance policy that’s enforced by the CAs.
* Clients can not force a CAA check to verify a certificate
  * "Relying Applications MUST NOT use CAA records as part of certificate validation"
  * "CAA records are intended to allow CAs to avoid mis-issuing certificates in some circumstances, while DANE records are intended to allow relying applications (TLS clients) to avoid relying on mis-issued certificates in some circumstances."
* Proposal implementation
  * Proposal passed - March 2017
  * Proposal implement date - September 2017
* CAA record creation is possible in the latest version of BIND, NSD, Knot, and PowerDNS.
* [SSL Labs already supports checking for CAA](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/issues/274)

# [EFF stupid patents blog under attack](https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/mailing/view?reset=1&id=2097)
* The company GEMSA owns a patent for virtual cabinets to represent different OS and partitions
* Recent litigation has been filed in Australia against EFF to withdraw the blog post
* On record GEMSA has filed multiple patent infringement cases in the US
* Law in the US (the SPEECH) act states foreign orders aren't enforceable if they go against free speech protections
* Lawsuits have been filed by both parties, GEMSA filed with slander charges and EFF to protect their free speech

# [UDP remote code execution on Linux 4.4 and below](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10229#vulnDescriptionTitle)
* UDP traffic can trigger an unsafe second checksum that allows remote code execution
* Apparently RedHat doesn't have this exploited code in their kernel so STDLinux is safe

# [Prison-made computers](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/inmates-built-computers-hidden-in-ceiling-connected-them-to-prison-network/?_utm_source=1-2-2)
* Inmates "made" (assembled) computers that they attached to the prison network
* Computers were loaded with porn and articles on drugs, explosives, and more.
* Components came from a computer recycling plant in the prison
* Computers were transported 1100 ft through checkpoints

# [Someone hacked every tornado siren in Dallas. It was loud](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C83bG_1UIAAiU4v.jpg)
* Friday, April 8, 2017
* 18 minutes before midnight
* For _an hour and a half_
* 156 emergency weather sirens
* [Map of siren locations](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C86cHfnUMAAWKkV.jpg)
* "Flummoxed officials had decided the only way to stop the noise was 'to unplug the radio systems and the repeater, and pretty much turn the siren system completely off.” 
* Officials have ruled out a remote hack
  * All indicators point to [HACKERMAN](http://i.imgur.com/BMSSPFJ.jpg)
* The attack was via a radio signal
* Storms are expected to roll into the region next week
